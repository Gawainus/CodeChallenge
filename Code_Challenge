/* This is similar to a challenge question I received while interviewing with Palantir. The question is hard, and therefore, 
I have only given what I belive to be the solution. Errors noticed and fixed are welcome. */

/* Question: Given a mXn matrix, that is full of elements, such that, for all x in mXn, x belongs to [0,1]. Please return the 
maximum number of rows where the row is either completely full or 0's or completely full of 1's, given that you can flip a column.
Fliping will allow you to convert the zeroes into ones and ones into zeroes for the corresponding column.
/* Ex:) 110
        001
Fliping column 1 yields - 010
                          101
Fliping column 2 yields - 100
                          011
